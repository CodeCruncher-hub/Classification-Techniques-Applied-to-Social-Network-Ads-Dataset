# Classification-Techniques-Applied-to-Social-Network-Ads-Dataset
This repository showcases the application of various supervised learning techniques to the Social Network Ads dataset. The dataset consists of five columns: User ID, Gender, Age, Salary, and whether a particular person purchased the product or not. We utilize the following classification algorithms to predict product purchases based on the available features:

# Random Forest:
We apply the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to achieve a more accurate and stable prediction. This helps in handling overfitting and improves the model's generalization to unseen data.

# Decision Tree: 
A Decision Tree classifier is used to model the decision-making process in a tree structure. This method is intuitive and provides clear insights into the feature importance and decision paths taken to classify whether a user will purchase the product.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM is employed to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with the maximum margin. This method is effective in high-dimensional spaces and helps in handling non-linear classification with the use of kernel tricks.

# XGBoost:
We utilize XGBoost, an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting, to enhance the model's performance. XGBoost is known for its speed and accuracy, making it a powerful tool for classification tasks.

Each of these techniques is applied with detailed preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and comparison, providing a comprehensive guide to implementing supervised learning methods on the Social Network Ads dataset.
